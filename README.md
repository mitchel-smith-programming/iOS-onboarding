<h1>Stock Clone App</h1>
Primarily a clone of the app following the udemy course "Build Complete Stocks App Clone in iOS, SwiftUI, Combine". Major change is using a mock news manager to provide example results of api calls due to a bug where requests to the news api were getting blocked due to a security issue. It appeared to have something to do with ZScaler.

<h1>Dicee</h1>
Following along with "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp", Dicee was completed across lessons as an introduction to working with IBOutlets in XCode.

<h1>I am Rich</h1>
Following along with "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp", I am Rich was completed as an introduction to Xcode storyboard mode

<h1>Calculator</h1>
Following along with "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp", Challenge project towards the end of the course.

<h1>Firebase Chat App</h1> 
Following along "Let's Build That App" course on youtube to design and build an instant messaging app using firebase. Minor changes throughout to make things look and feel more how I want them to. One major change is around the text entry box for new messages from a TextField to a TextEditor and using @Focused to implement iphone-like default text (color change, having indicator text, preserving text if you've typed something then lost focus or refilling the indicator text if you haven't)
